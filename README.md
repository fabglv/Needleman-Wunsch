# Needleman-Wunsch

A C implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for sequence alignment, commonly used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences.

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that guarantees finding the optimal global alignment between two sequences.

## Execution

You will be prompted to enter two sequences for alignment.

### Example Input

```
Enter string 1: AT
Enter string 2: AGGT
```

### Example Output

The program will display:
1. The input sequences
2. The dynamic programming matrix (D matrix)
3. The traceback matrix (T matrix)
4. The optimal alignment of the sequences
